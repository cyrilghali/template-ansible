# Groups are nice for organization, but that’s not all groups are good for. You can also assign variables to them! For instance, atlanta has its own NTP servers, so when setting up ntp.conf, we should use them. Let’s set those now:
# file: group_vars/atlanta
ntp: ntp-atlanta.example.com
backup: backup-atlanta.example.com
